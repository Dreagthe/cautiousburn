High Priority Tasks-

    Check for and Remove Code Duplication: Especially in gamemap.py and teams.py.
    Error Handling: Add mechanisms, particularly in parts interacting with external resources or relying on user input.
    Logging: Implement logging to track application behavior and errors.
    Unit Tests: Write tests for your functions and classes.
    Initialize Game Loop: Set up the main loop to control game flow.
    Game State Management: Implement logic to update the game state during each iteration of the game loop.
    User Input Handling: Add logic to handle real-time user input during the game loop.
    Rendering and Graphics: Implement real-time rendering logic, if applicable.
    Performance Profiling: Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks that could affect game performance.
    Type Annotations: Add these to function signatures for better readability and error checking.

Medium Priority Tasks-

    Split main.py: Break it into smaller, more focused modules.
    Review and Standardize Imports: Across all files for consistency.
    Add Comments and Docstrings: For each function and class.
    Code Formatting: Follow a standard code style like PEP 8.
    Function Decomposition: Break down long functions.
    Class Abstraction: Create abstract classes for shared methods.
    Use Constants: Replace magic numbers and strings.
    Asynchronous Programming: For I/O-bound or high-level network code.
    Database Integration: If you need to store game state or player data.
    User Interface: Develop a UI for easier interaction.

Lower Priority Tasks

    Configuration Files: Move settings to a configuration file.
    Regular Updates: Implement a way to update your program without a complete reinstall.
    Internationalization: Prepare your code for multiple languages.
    Clean up Global Variables: Encapsulate them in classes or pass them as function arguments.
    Code Review: Have someone else review your code.
    Version Control: Use a system like Git if not already in use.
    Packaging: Prepare your code for distribution.
 
 
 
 
 
    Recommended Algorithms

    Pathfinding Algorithms: If your game involves navigation, algorithms like A* could be beneficial.
    Machine Learning Algorithms: For more complex decision-making logic, you might want to explore reinforcement learning algorithms.
    Sorting Algorithms: For any ranking or sorting logic, consider quicksort or mergesort for efficiency.
    Graph Algorithms: If you're dealing with networked entities or connections, graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm can be useful.
